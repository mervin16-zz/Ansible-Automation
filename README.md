# Ansible Automation

This is a simple Ansible Automation project which contains several playbooks automating tasks across different platforms.

## Playbooks

The project currently has playbooks categorized in a folder for each platforms. The available platforms are:

- Fortinet Firewalls
- Checkpoint Firewalls
- Cisco IOS
- Linux Systems


## Installation

You need to have Ansible installed and configured to be able to run the playbooks. 

To install Ansible, please follow this [guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

To run the playbooks for each platform, individual collections for each platforms need to be installed through Ansible Galaxy. Below are the commands for each platforms' collection to install.
